# Medical-insurance-cost-prediction

This project involves predicting medical insurance costs based on various features using linear regression. The dataset used is from Kaggle and is named insurance.csv. Linear regression is employed to model the relationship between the features and the cost of insurance.

**Dataset**


The dataset insurance.csv contains the following columns:

age: The age of the individual.
sex: The gender of the individual (male/female).
bmi: The Body Mass Index of the individual.
children: The number of children/dependents.
smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
region: The region where the individual lives (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
charges: The medical insurance charges (the target variable).

**Objective**

The goal is to develop a linear regression model that can predict the charges based on the other features. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Steps**

1.Data Preprocessing:
Load and inspect the dataset.
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables (e.g., sex, smoker, region).
Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of features and the target variable.
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
Check for multicollinearity among features.

3.Feature Engineering:
Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance.

4.Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model on the training set.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared on the test set.

5.Model Evaluation:
Compare the performance of the model with other regression models if applicable.
Interpret the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
lib:Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
